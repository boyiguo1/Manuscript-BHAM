# Discussion

Remaining issue:
1. Degree of freedom has yet to closely studied. As an direct impact, the functional selection can be improved when effective degree of freedom are more carefully studied
2. While the proposed model addresses a great deal of analytic problem, analyzing the time-to-event outcome remains unsolved. Our current effort resides on expanding. An naive approach could be convert an time-to-event outcome to a poisson outcome following xxx. Hence, the . However, it would be more efficient to , via penalized pseudo likelihood function, which is the current effort resides.
2. Future exapansion, as we were analyzing the metabolites data, we observed that metabolites pathway infromation can be useful in the predictive and integrative model can be developed based on the proposed framework. As an naive solution, the selection indicator of linear effect of the spline terms of all metabolites on the same pathway can be set to share the same hyper prior such that the group selection can be modestly achieved. Meanwhile further advancedment of the methodology regarding to the integrative analysis can consider setting the hypor priors of the selection indivator of the non-linear components conditioning on the probability of inclusion of the linear effect. Such structure is more sensible analytically.
