abstract = {We introduce the spike-and-slab group lasso (SSGL) for Bayesian estimation and variable selection in linear regression with grouped variables. We further extend the SSGL to sparse generalized additive models (GAMs), thereby introducing the first nonparametric variant of the spike-and-slab lasso methodology. Our model simultaneously performs group selection and estimation, while our fully Bayes treatment of the mixture proportion allows for model complexity control and automatic self-adaptivity to different levels of sparsity. We develop theory to uniquely characterize the global posterior mode under the SSGL and introduce a highly efficient block coordinate ascent algorithm for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We further employ de-biasing methods to provide uncertainty quantification of our estimates. Thus, implementation of our model avoids the computational intensiveness of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in high dimensions. We derive posterior concentration rates for both grouped linear regression and sparse GAMs when the number of covariates grows at nearly exponential rate with sample size. Finally, we illustrate our methodology through extensive simulations and data analysis.},

@article{Scheipl2012,
abstract = {Structured additive regression (STAR) provides a general framework for complex Gaussian and non-Gaussian regression models, with predictors comprising arbitrary combinations of nonlinear functions and surfaces, spatial effects, varying coefficients, random effects, and further regression terms. The large flexibility of STAR makes function selection a challenging and important task, aiming at (1) selecting the relevant covariates, (2) choosing an appropriate and parsimonious representation of the impact of covariates on the predictor, and (3) determining the required interactions. We propose a spike-and-slab prior structure for function selection that allows to include or exclude single coefficients as well as blocks of coefficients representing specific model terms. A novel multiplicative parameter expansion is required to obtain good mixing and convergence properties in a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation approach and is shown to induce desirable shrinkage properties. In simulation studies and with (real) benchmark classification data, we investigate sensitivity to hyperparameter settings and compare performance to competitors. The flexibility and applicability of our approach are demonstrated in an additive piecewise exponential model with time-varying effects for right-censored survival times of intensive care patients with sepsis. Geoadditive and additive mixed logit model applications are discussed in an extensive online supplement. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Statistical Association.},
annote = {semiparametric regression model can be solved when treating as mixed models. Scheipl, Fahrmeir, Kneib (2012) proposed an new spike-and-slab structure prior, normal-mixture -of-inverse gamma (NMIG) for semiparmtric regression using MCMC. The NMIG prior is mixtrue of t-distribution with an additional coerfficients mixing vector, where the vector follows a mixtureof two Gaussian distribution.},
